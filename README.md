<h1>On-premises Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>
This tutorial outlines the implementation of on-premises Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines.<br />


<h2>Video Demonstration</h2>

- ### [YouTube: How to Deploy on-premises Active Directory within Azure Compute](https://www.youtube.com)

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>High-Level Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

- Set Up an Azure Virtual Network
- Deploy a Windows Server Virtual Machine
- Install and Configure Active Directory Domain Services

<h2>Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

Firstly we are going to create a VNet within Microsoft Azure. This will be The Virtual Network (VNet) used to provide a secure and isolated network environment for deploying Active Directory (AD). It acts as the foundation for network communication between domain controllers, client machines, and other Azure resources.

Next we have the Virtual Machine (VM) that we will be using. This Virtual Machine serves as a Domain Controller (DC), which is responsible for managing authentication, security policies, and directory services.

- We will need to configure some network settings for the domain controller within Microsoft Azure. To locate these settings follow these steps. Virtual Machine/Networking/Network settings/Network interface/Ipconfig/Private ip allocation. Change setting from dynamic to static.

<p>
Here we are configuring settings on the main Domain Controller. We are going to begin configuring the server by enabling Active Directory Domain and Services. 

  - You will need to configure a new domain to actually have a domain on your server. To do this locate the Active Directory Domain Configuration Services, and select "add new forest" here you can name your domain and select continue.
